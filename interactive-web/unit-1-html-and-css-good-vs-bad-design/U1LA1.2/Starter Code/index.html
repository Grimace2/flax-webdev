  <h1>Where Do Pandas Live?</h1>
  <li><h3>Giant pandas live exclusively in the high, damp mountain ranges of south-central China, primarily in the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi,
     and Gansu. Pandas are found only in China due to their historical evolution and specialization in the specific mountainous habitats of 
     central China, which provide the dense bamboo forests and isolation they need to thrive. </h3></li>

    <h1>What Do Pandas Eat?</h1>

  <li><h3>Pandas primarily eat bamboo, which makes up the vast majority of their diet. They consume 
    different parts of the bamboo plant, including leaves, stems, and shoots, depending on the
     season. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas have adapted to a mostly herbivorous
      diet. Occasionally, they may eat small animals, birds, or eggs, but this is rare.
       Since bamboo is low in nutrients, pandas spend many hours each day eating to meet their
        energy needs.</h3></li>

    <h1> How Do Pandas Survive?</h1>

    <li><h3> Pandas survive by eating a lot of bamboo, which is their main food. They have strong teeth 
      and jaws that help them chew tough bamboo stalks. Pandas live in cool mountain forests in China 
      where bamboo grows. Their thick fur keeps them warm in the cold weather. Even though they like 
      to be alone, they use smells and sounds to find other pandas and stay safe.</h3></li>
