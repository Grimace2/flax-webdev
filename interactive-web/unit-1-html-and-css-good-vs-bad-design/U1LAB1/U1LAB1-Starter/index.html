		<h2> Who is Patrick?</h2>
		<div class="green">
			<p>
				<h3> Patrick Star is a cartoon character from the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. He is a pink 
      starfish who lives under a rock in the underwater city of
       Bikini Bottom. Patrick is best friends with SpongeBob and
        is known for his goofy personality and lack of intelligence. 
        Despite often getting things wrong, he has a good heart and 
        is loyal to his friends. His silly behavior and childlike 
        humor make him one of the show's most beloved characters.

			<p>
				<h4>Patrick Star won the trophy for "Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer 
          Than Anyone Else" because he literally would he sit around and do
           absolutely nothing for an impressively long time. In the episode Big 
           Pink Loser, this award is given to Patrick as a joke, highlighting
            Patrick’s extreme laziness and lack of motivation. He proudly accepts
             the trophy without realizing it's not exactly something to be proud 
             of</h4>

			<h4>The Patrick Star Show is a silly and fun cartoon where Patrick has his 
        own TV show that he hosts from his house. He goes on crazy adventures 
        with his family and makes up weird and funny stuff as he goes along. 
        The show is kind of random, but it’s entertaining because you never know 
        what Patrick will do next.Each episode feels like a mix of a talk show, 
        a dream, and a cartoon all in one. Even though it’s weird, that’s what
         makes it fun and different from other shows.</h4>

					<h3> Defeating villains with SpongeBob</h3>
					<img src="images.jpeg" alt="patrick" width="500" height="400"/>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Patrick used to fight villains along with SpongeBob in several 
        episodes and movies, usually by accident or with silly methods. 
        Even though he's not very smart, he always tries his best to help his 
        best friend. In The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, Patrick wears fishnet 
        stockings and helps SpongeBob defeat the evil Cyclops and stop Plankton’s
         plan. He also helps battle other villains like Man Ray and the Dirty
          Bubble, usually with more luck than skill. Patrick might not be the 
          strongest or smartest hero, but his loyalty and bravery make him a
           great sidekick.</h4>
